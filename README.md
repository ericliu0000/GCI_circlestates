# State of Circles

**Description**

This repository contains the code for the Fedora Project Google Code-in task: "Code an app that shows the state of 2 circles." The object of this task was to, given three inputs: the radii of two circles, and the center-to-center distance of those two circles, figure out if the circles are tangential, intersect twice, do not intersect, or are concentric. Additionally, the output must show both circles.

This program was written in Python, using Pygame to draw the canvas. When the program is run, three numerical inputs are requested: the radii of the two circles, in no particular order, and the distance between the center of the two circles. The program will run once, until the user stops it by closing the Pygame window.
